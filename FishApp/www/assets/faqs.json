          "body":"Our core mission is to provide chemical-free, unadulterated food to consumers. We take great pains to ensure that we go directly to the fishermen or farmers without any middlemen in between and buy the freshest of fresh food straight from the source. Further, we follow the most modern & scientific transportation and packaging processes from source till your door steps. This ensures that the required temperature and other conditions for healthy preservation of meats is met using nothing but natural ice as the preservative."

          "body":"How we wish that were true! We have observed that a large percentage of the fish available in the local market has Ammonia in them. A smaller percentage has Formalin."

          "title":"How do you manage to deliver it so fresh?",
          "body":"Simple - we procure the day's catch from fisherman hours after they actually fish and come to the shore. Our well oil-ed processing center ensures that the fresh catch reaches our plants with in no time of the catch landing on the shore. At our delivery end, we have a network of vehicles that pick up the product from the airport\/train stations and deliver to your doorsteps. We do not depend on any courier companies and have sourcing and delivery fully under our control - while this is expensive, it allows us to give you the worlds best fish in the fastest time possible from source to destination."

          "title":"How fresh is the seafood brought from coastalFish?",
          "body":"The fish reaches your home with in a few hours of catch landing from the sea- our estimate is that it is in your kitchen within 20 to 35 hours of catch landing at the harbor. The catch is not treated with chemicals such as formalin, Chlorine or Ammonia, which means what we supply, is the safest and healthiest seafood you can buy. Almost all seafood you find in your local market is invariably treated with one or other chemicals to preserve it. These chemicals are harmful to human beings and actually deprive the seafood of its freshness and natural taste."

          "title":"How on time are you guys?",
          "body":"We have our own logistics and delivery work force, so we have a fair amount of control on our schedules. The two factors that are not in our control are train and airline schedules - our two primary means of supply in to the Cities. However these are extra ordinary situations and barring acts of God, we deliver on time 99.99% of the time."

          "title":"Does the taste of fish vary from coast to coast?",
          "body":"Yes, there is a big difference in taste of the same fish caught in one ecosystem versus the other. For example - it is very well known that the best tasting Hilsa actually comes from the fresh waters in Bangladesh. Similarly for Marine fish, some of the best tasting fish comes from the southern coasts of India, especially the Kerala belt where there are a lot of lagoons. The waters there are comparatively pollution free and this enhances the taste. The fish caught from polluted waters will generally have pollutant\/toxin accumulation in the tissue leading to bad taste and unsavoury odour. The southern seas in general are well protected from factory effluents and sewage It is also scientifically proven that the taste of the fish is directly linked to the fatty acid and amino acid profiles of the organisms on which they feed on! If the prey has a better nutritional profile, it will contribute to the profile of the predator. For example, Kerala waters are almost free from toxic dinoflagellates and other phytoplankton blooms which make the fish safe and tasty for consumption."

          "title":"Why do you charge a delivery charge?",
          "body":"We provide fish that is a week to 6 months fresher than the fish that you currently get from the market and deliver that at potentially much lower prices than the local market. What this means is that we operate with razor thin margins and for us to break even we need to add a delivery charge based on the location. As our volumes increase, we are hoping we can lower this cost."
